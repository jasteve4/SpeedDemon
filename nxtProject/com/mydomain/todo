Use counters to change PID gains

increase P
	decrease rise time
	increase overshoot
	small change in settling time
	decrease steady state error
	degrade stability
increase I
	decrease rise time
	increase overshoot
	increase settling time
	eliminate steady state error
	degrade stability
increase D
	minor change rise time
	decrease overshoot
	decrease settling time
	no effect on steady state error
	improve stability if small kd
